Replace the placeholder {{grouping_field}} with the field to group the data by, if appropriate. Otherwise you may choose to omit this portion of the query. \n
Replace the placeholder {{ordering_field}} with the field to order the data by, if appropriate. Otherwise you may choose to omit this portion of the query. \n
Make sure to enclose each of the query fields with double quotes (") in order to ensure that the SQL query is properly formatted. \n
