Dynamic World predictions are available for the Sentinel-2 L1C collection from 2015-06-27 to present. The revisit frequency of Sentinel-2 is between 2-5 days depending on latitude. Dynamic World predictions are generated for Sentinel-2 L1C images with CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE <= 35%. Predictions are masked to remove clouds and cloud shadows using a combination of S2 Cloud Probability, Cloud Displacement Index, and Directional Distance Transform. Given Dynamic World class estimations are derived from single images using a spatial context from a small moving window, top-1 'probabilities' for predicted land covers that are in-part defined by cover over time, like crops, can be comparatively low in the absence of obvious distinguishing features. High-return surfaces in arid climates, sand, sunglint, etc may also exhibit this phenomenon.  To select only pixels that confidently belong to a Dynamic World class, it is recommended to mask Dynamic World outputs by thresholding the estimated 'probability' of the top-1 prediction. \",\n",

Here, 'forest' is defined as the natural forest with the area larger than 0.5 ha and forest cover over 10%. This definition is the same as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition.
